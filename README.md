# Hackerman theme

i've been wondering on how could i combine my favorite themes in vs code and turn then into a new one, so after watching a video made by <a href="https://github.com/thecodercoder" target="blank">thecodercoder</a> i've made my very first color theme. This theme was made combining my personal favorites <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EliverLara.andromeda" target="blank">Andromeda</a> made by <a href="https://github.com/EliverLara" target="blank">Eliver L.</a> and <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Carlos18mz.cyberpunk-2077-rebuild" target="blank">Cyberpunk 2077 rebuild</a> made by <a href="https://github.com/carlos18mz" target="blank">Carlos MZ</a>.
