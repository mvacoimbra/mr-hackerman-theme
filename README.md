# Hackerman theme

<!-- i've been wondering on how could i combine my favorite themes in vs code and turn then into a new one, so after watching a video made by <a href="https://github.com/thecodercoder" target="blank">thecodercoder</a> i've made my very first color theme. This theme was made combining my personal favorites Andromeda made by Eliver L. and Cyberpunk 2077 rebuild made by Carlos MZ. -->
